# Selection Sort in Java

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm in Java. The program sorts an array of integers in ascending or descending order based on user input.

## Files

The main file in this repository is `SelectionSort.java`, which contains the implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm.

## Code Overview

The `SelectionSort.java` file contains three main methods:

1. `selectionSort(int[] arr, int order)`: This method sorts an array of integers using the Selection Sort algorithm. The `order` parameter determines whether the array is sorted in ascending (`order = 1`) or descending (`order = 2`) order.

2. `printArray(int[] arr)`: This method prints the elements of an array.

3. `main(String[] args)`: This method gets the number of elements, the elements themselves, and the sorting order from the user. It then calls the `selectionSort` method to sort the array and prints the original and sorted arrays.

## Usage

To run the code, compile the `SelectionSort.java` file and run the `main` method. The program will prompt you to enter the number of elements, the elements themselves, and the sorting order.

The output will display the original array and the sorted array.
